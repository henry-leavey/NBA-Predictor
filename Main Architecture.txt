--- Manage Data---
Get win streaks, see if win streak affects winning chances
Momentum indicator, last ten games win percentage

Get the days rested since last game
Put in a bar chart to see how it affects performance
see if more days rested = more chance of winning next game

---Feature engineering---
Check whether top 30 predictors are supposed to be on only the features that are used
for inference. The model should only be trained on features that can be inputted into the 
model when used to find a prediction.

Features such as the teams playing, whos at home, and the rolling averages from the last 10 games
are the only features that should be used for training. If other features are used (data leakage)
the model is trained on features it should not know.

Do not use future features which give information the model wouldnt have

---Split data correctly---
If its time series data make sure the data is not shuffled
